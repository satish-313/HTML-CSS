        <p id="etymology">
            According to the Oxford English Dictionary (Third Edition 2009), <br>
            the name "India" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference<br>
            to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived <br>
            successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos<br>
            ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire;<br>
            and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river," specifically<br>
            the Indus river and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[60][61]<br>
            The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as<br>
            "The people of the Indus".

        <p id="history">
            By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived<br>
            on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[69][70][71]<br>
            The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.<br>
            [72] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, <br>
            construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared<br>
            in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan.[73] These gradually developed<br>
            into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[74][73] the first urban culture in South Asia,[75] <br>
            which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.

        <p id="geography">
            India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, <br>
            a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[161] India's defining geological processes began 75 million <br>
            years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a <br>
            north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.<br>
            [161] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the<br>
            Eurasian Plate.[161] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the <br>
            Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift <br>
            the Himalayas.[161] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough<br>
            that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[162] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[163] <br>
            Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli Range lies the Thar Desert.[164]

        <p id="biodiversity">
            India is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological<br>
            diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[182] India <br>
            is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species,<br>
            6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[183]<br>
            [184] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[185] India also contains four of the<br>
            world's 34 biodiversity hotspots,[57] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the <br>
            presence of high endemism.

        <p id="economy">
            According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2019 was nominally <br>
            presence of high endemism.worth $2.9 trillion; it is the fifth-largest economy by market exchange <br>
            rates, and is around $11 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity, or PPP.[19] <br>
            With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% <br>
            during 2011–2012,[284] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.[285] However, <br>
            the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at <br>
            PPP.[286] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced <br>
            by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy <br>
            off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to <br>
            liberalise its economy;[287] since then it has moved slowly towards a free-market system[288][289] <br>
            by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[290] India has been a member of <br>
            WTO since 1 January 1995.
